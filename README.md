# SculptingMorphology

This code is assosiated with the ALIFE paper " Evolution  of  morphology  through  sculpting  in  a  voxel  based  robot" by Kathryn Walker and Helmut Hauser.

To run the code please first refer to Sam Kreigman's evosoro repository (skreigman/evosoro) for set-up instructions.
Then the code can be run via create_population_test.py without any inputs.

This particular code is configured for locomotion in the sloped environment. To change to a different environment, for example the flat environment, change the file_write_up.py file.
